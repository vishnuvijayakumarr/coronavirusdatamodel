Dedicated to the Coronavirus Data Model, a program that uses Linear Regression to predict confirmed cases of the virus in a one month time span in India. Constructive feedback is appreciated.

DATA: https://github.com/datasets/covid-19.git. Special thanks to the people who organized the data. 

## Linear Regression
Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable.
For example, a modeler might want to relate the weights of individuals to their heights using a linear regression model.
A linear regression line has an equation of the form **Y = a + bX**, where **X** is the explanatory variable and **Y** is the dependent variable. 
The slope of the line is **b**, and **a** is the intercept (the value of y when x = 0). (Yale University 1997-1998)
